1: Created plot using pandas by data.csv given

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1:For titanic dataset, did two visualizations(spread sheet and heat map) to show corelations

Ans to 1: a)Yes, we should keep the 'Survived' and 'Sex' features helps classify the data accurately

Implemented Naive Bayers method and reported accuracy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2:For glass dataset, did two visualizations(spread sheet and heat map) to show corelations

Implemented using Naive Bayers method and SVM and reported accuracy

Ans to 2: We got better accuracy for Na√Øve Bayes method which is 0.83. Naive Bayes analysis works well with probabilistic concepts where as Linear SVM works better with linear regression logics. But to perform more accurately SVM requires large amounts of data to train and test the data. So, due to the amount of data Naive Bayes algorith gives better accuracy compared to Linear SVM.
